# sven.eisenschmidt.website

My personal website, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

I use [`TONE_OF_VOICE.md`](TONE_OF_VOICE.md) to keep my writing consistent when working with AI tools.

## Development

```bash
make dev
```

## Deploy

Push to `main` and GitHub Actions builds and uploads via FTP.

## License

Content is mine. Do what you want with the code. Happy if it inspires your own Hugo site.
