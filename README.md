# sven.eisenschmidt.website

My personal website, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

I use a `TONE_OF_VOICE.md` file (not in repo) to keep my writing style consistent when using AI tools.

## Development

```bash
make dev
```

## Deploy

Push to `main`. GitHub Actions handles the rest.

## License

Content is mine. Code is whatever, do what you want with it. Happy if it inspires your own Hugo site.
