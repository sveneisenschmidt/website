Perfect mix between logistics, base building and shooter action. I like it more than the Metal Gear Solid games.</p><img src=IMG_0448.jpg alt="Death Stranding 2: On The Beach running on my Steam Deck OLED" class=hero><p>I played it on a Steam Deck OLED via PS Remote Play connected to a PS5 Pro. The experience was flawless. I used <a href=https://flathub.org/en/apps/io.github.streetpea.Chiaki4deck>chiaki-ng</a> and have a WiFi 6 capable network at home.</p><img src=IMG_0447.jpg alt="Start screen of Chiaki4deck" class=hero><p>The story was emotionally draining. Typical for Kojima, he takes the liberty to add things for the sake of coolness, not because they make sense. &ldquo;Sense&rdquo; in the context of an already nuts story and universe. <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/1m7oqbq/death_stranding_2_a_beautiful_ending_wrapped_in/>This Reddit thread</a> tied up the loose ends for me and explained things that are never explicitly resolved in the game, at least to my understanding.</p><p>Favorite performances: Lea Seydoux as Fragile and Troy Baker as Higgs. Baker&rsquo;s performance is nuts. Tommie Earl Jenkins deserves a mention too. Spoiler: his return at the end of the game and his unusual performance were a nice balance to the overall sad story.</p><p>Also surprised by Kojima&rsquo;s thing for German actors and directors. Alissa Jung and Fatih Akin both have roles. I wonder what made him choose them.</p><p>Final rating: 9/10.</p><div><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/gaming/>Gaming</a></div></main><footer><p>Copyright 2026.
