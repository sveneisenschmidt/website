I manage reading a few pages maybe one evening every two weeks. I can turn on something on Youtube or a podcast in the car without thinking. A book I have to actively pick up.

We have two Silkie chickens and two feather-footed dwarf chickens. The whole family loves them, and two eggs a day is a nice bonus.

The fresh snow melted during the day but froze overnight, leaving icy patches everywhere. Plenty of slipping and sliding along the way, with the kids landing on their backsides more than once. Aika seemed completely unfazed.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Feels like they built a movie around a soundtrack. I knew it was questionable renting it and still left disappointed by its lack of substance. The 3D printing and digitization of matter was the coolest bit.

The game is a perfect mix between logistics, base building and shooter action for me.I like it more than the Metal Gear Solid games.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Each season felt like it had a different plan for the next. The finale was sentimental but without weight. Dark and 1899 did this better.
