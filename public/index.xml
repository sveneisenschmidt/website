[…]Craspedia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae commonly known as billy buttons, billy balls, and woollyheads. They are native to Australia and New Zealand where they grow in a variety of habitats from sea level to the Southern Alps.[…] (Wikipedia) - I’d would have called them yellow balls.

Yet here we are and we spent this afternoon at the vet.

The fresh snow melted during the day but froze overnight, leaving icy patches everywhere. Plenty of slipping and sliding along the way, with the kids landing on their backsides more than once. Aika seemed completely unfazed.
