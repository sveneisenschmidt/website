      <description>&lt;p&gt;This website runs on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator written in Go. I launched it in early January 2026, so if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this when it&amp;rsquo;s fresh, this is all just a few days old. This post documents how I built it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A winter walk with Tilian and Aika. The fresh snow has been melting during the day but freezing overnight, leaving icy patches everywhere. Plenty of slipping and sliding along the way, with the kids landing on their backsides more than once. Aika seemed completely unfazed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tron: Ares (5/10)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Feels like they built a movie around a soundtrack. I knew it was questionable renting it and still left disappointed by its lack of substance. The 3D printing and digitization of matter was the coolest bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My year 2025 in numbers and highlights, wrapped-style. First attempt at summarizing an eventful year. More platforms offering wrapped/replay summaries obviously helped.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the Xmas period I managed to finish Death Stranding 2. The game is a perfect mix between logistics, base building and shooter action for me.I like it more than the Metal Gear Solid games.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;End of 2025 I spent 100 hours on a single open source project. I did similar things over the past twenty years (oh my!) but always lost interest. This time was different. The software is actually used at my company. Spoiler: I will happily discontinue it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Stranger Things (Season 5) (6/10)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Each season felt like it had a different plan for the next. The finale was sentimental but without weight. Dark and 1899 did this better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
