# Tone of Voice

Guidelines for writing and reviewing content on this site.

## Before You Start

**Always read existing blog posts first.** The posts in `content/posts/` represent the current writing style. Read them before writing or reviewing new content. Style evolves - the existing posts are the source of truth.

## Tone & Voice

- **Conversational**: Write like you're talking to a friend who knows tech. Not formal, not sloppy.
- **Direct and concise**: No fluff, gets to the point quickly.
- **Warm but not soft**: Show personality through asides and reactions, not through padding.
- **Dry humor**: Subtle wit through self-deprecation and observation, not punchlines or rhetorical questions.
- **Authentic**: Unapologetically opinionated, doesn't try to please everyone.
- **Anti-corporate**: Avoids buzzwords and marketing speak.
- **Self-deprecating**: Humble about achievements, honest about mistakes.
- **Vulnerable without demanding sympathy**: Acknowledge difficulty or frustration honestly.
- **Self-aware**: Acknowledge own limitations and knowledge gaps openly.

## Structure

- Short paragraphs, often single sentences or 2-3 lines.
- Uses lists for clarity.
- Minimal headers, only when needed.
- No unnecessary introductions or conclusions.
- Varied sentence length for rhythm - short declarations as breaks after longer passages.

## Content

- Technical but accessible - explain through wonder, not jargon.
- Practical over theoretical.
- Personal anecdotes welcome, but brief.
- Links to sources/references when relevant.
- **Concrete specificity**: Name specific things (albums, products, prices, numbers) instead of vague generalizations.
- Honest about what you don't know.

## Rhythm & Pacing

- Short sentences as rhythmic breaks ("I love it.", "Feels good.").
- Complex thoughts unpacked across multiple sentences, not crammed into one.
- Topic shifts feel organic, not forced with awkward transitions.
- Parenthetical asides for casual commentary and personality (but don't overuse).
- Mix technical explanation with personal reaction - don't just describe, react.

## AI Slop Patterns (kill on sight)

- Rhetorical questions as transitions ("Retro or wise?", "But what does this mean?")
- Generic summarizing statements ("Simple enough to understand, simple enough to maintain")
- Unnecessary qualifiers ("very", "really", "quite", "actually")
- Marketing speak ("faster first paint", "one less request", "more approachable")
- Vague generalizations instead of concrete examples
- Generic statements that sound like universal truths ("The key to success is...")
- Forced transitions ("But this time I did something different...")
- Empty disclaimers ("Nothing custom here, just how X works out of the box")
- Unnecessary negations/justifications ("The site isn't just a blog")
- Choppy noun-phrase sentences that should be one proper sentence ("The fix is GitHub Actions. FTP credentials in repository secrets.")

## Content Issues (avoid)

- Cryptocurrency or blockchain topics
- Emojis (never use them)
- Excessive exclamation marks
- Corporate buzzwords ("synergy", "leverage", "disrupt", "game-changer")
- Over-explaining obvious things
- Clickbait titles or engagement bait
- Sentences that could appear in any blog post (not specific)
- Passive voice where active would be stronger
- Paragraphs longer than 3-4 sentences
- Making assumptions about details not provided
- Inventing numbers or facts without confirmation
- Impersonal openings that avoid first person
- Em dashes (—) and en dashes (–) - use hyphens or restructure instead

## Writing Balance

- Short sentences need context. Too many in a row feels choppy.
- Combine sentences that belong together logically.
- Single-word sentences or fragments ("PHP.") work for effect, but use sparingly.
- When content is too short, add personality through reactions and asides, not filler.
- Technical content needs breathing room - add personal observations between dense sections.
- Don't be so compressed that warmth disappears. Let sentences breathe occasionally.

## Language

- Primarily English
- German when appropriate for local context
- Informal but professional

## Formatting Conventions

- **Links remove bold** - When a title becomes a link, remove `**bold**` formatting.
- **Paraphrase user input** - Focus on the gist, do not copy word by word. Fix spelling and restructure sentences.
- **List entry pattern** - Games/Movies/Music entries follow: `[Title](url) *Genre* - stats, rating. (Comment.)`
- **Link sources by category** - Use Metacritic for games, IMDB for movies/TV shows, Last.fm for music.
