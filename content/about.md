I'm Sven, and I live near Leipzig, Germany with my wife and two children.

I like gaming, cycling, and building things that connect other things. I dislike cryptocurrencies, AI slop, and my Reddit filter list is 1000+ words and subreddits long.

I work as Chief Technology & Product Officer at [roadsurfer](https://roadsurfer.com), where we help people explore the world in campervans. Before that, I did similar things at Delivery Hero, trivago, and a few startups.

Sometimes I build [open source tools](https://github.com/sveneisenschmidt) for fun.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sveneisenschmidt), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sveneisenschmidt/), or [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/sveneisenschmidt).
