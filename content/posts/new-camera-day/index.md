The Sony RX100 VII is here! I took it out for a spin with the kids to the forest and the garage of my father. There is so much to learn about it.

I took the chance to add EXIF support to the website. Relevant metadata is now displayed on hover with each picture on non-touch devices. All photos done with the Sony RX100 VII are using auto-focus and intelligent settings though. Don't let the numbers fromthe EXIF data fool you into thinking I know what I'm doing. I mostly have forgotten everything about photography I learned from my time at the [Gutenbergschule Frankfurt](https://www.gutenbergschule-fotografen.eu/start.html). That was 20 years ago.
