A winter walk with Tilian and Aika. The fresh snow has been melting during the day but freezing overnight, leaving icy patches everywhere. Plenty of slipping and sliding along the way, with the kids landing on their backsides more than once. Aika seemed completely unfazed. 

Starting my daily photo journey, inspired by [Jasper's daily photos](https://jasper.tandy.is/daily) who is on a 337-day streak. I hope this will help me reflect more consciously on the past.
