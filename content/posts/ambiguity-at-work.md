Ambiguity gets a bad reputation at work, and people treat it like a warning sign. "There's no clear direction." "Leadership doesn't have a plan." I've sat in meetings where someone said exactly that, and everyone nodded along.

Ten years ago I would have agreed because back then I wanted clarity, defined requirements, a plan I could follow. I thought that's what good leadership looked like: removing uncertainty so people can execute.

Then I got my first management role and suddenly complaining about unclear requirements wasn't useful anymore. As a developer I could point at the mess and say "this isn't defined well enough," but as a manager nobody cared. If I had kept saying "this isn't defined well enough" in that role, what would have happened in my next performance review? I probably wouldn't be where I am today. I wasn't measured by the code I wrote, I was measured by whether my team hit its goals, and hitting those goals isn't just some corporate phrase. It's often about whether a product survives or gets killed, whether a vision lives on or gets abandoned, whether the company makes it or doesn't. There was no option to not deliver.

The projects where I had the most impact weren't the ones with perfect specs and detailed roadmaps, they were the messy ones. The ones where someone said "figure it out" and meant it, not because anyone trusted me specifically, but because there was a goal and someone had to make it happen.

Here's what I think people get wrong: they confuse ambiguity with the absence of strategy. But strategy doesn't tell you what to do, it tells you what you're not and sets boundaries. Principles tell you who you are, but neither hands you a playbook. The space in between is yours to fill.

Over the years I've seen people respond to ambiguity in different ways. Some hold on to old plans because the roadmap said X, so we're doing X. But if the business reality changed in the last four weeks, how can you not react to that? The plan was based on assumptions, the assumptions changed, and the plan is now fiction.

Others treat ambiguity as permission to make calls, to try things, to be wrong and adjust. Those are the people who ship things that weren't on anyone's roadmap but solved real problems.

The uncomfortable truth nobody wants to hear is that there is no certainty in product development. We're building things for eight billion people, markets shift, competitors do things you didn't expect, and users behave in ways that make no sense until suddenly they do. If you need everything nailed down before you start, you're too slow.

We're not surgeons, pilots, or paramedics. Those jobs need fixed routines because mistakes kill people, but software development isn't like that. If we ship something wrong we can fix it, and if we make a bad call we learn and adjust. The cost of being wrong is low, the cost of being slow is high.

Two things help: being data-driven and being fast. Data-driven isn't about having all the answers upfront, it's about moving, measuring, and correcting course. And speed matters more than people admit because the problem with software development is that it often takes forever, and by the time you ship the world moved on. Ambiguity rewards people who can make decisions quickly and live with being wrong sometimes.

Bias to action sounds like a buzzword until you've spent three weeks in a planning loop that produced nothing but excel sheets.

I've seen scale-ups try to establish behaviors, processes, and rules that would kill any startup within weeks. The desire to play it safe, to wait for clarity, to not move until everything is defined. That's a slow death. If you're not proactive and ambitious, you're just waiting for someone else to outrun you.

Ambiguity isn't a threat to manage, it's the space where you get to shape what happens next.
