Tilian is sick and Kellin has been quarantined as a precaution. I am on a work trip to Munich so it was extra difficult to leave them until tomorrow night.

Being away clashes with the delivery of my new Sony RX VII which I am excited for. I was lucky to reschedule the delivery to Friday. I spent the time on the trip to listen to a few more reviews and get more familiar with it - [Henry's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF-SR-wflug) stood out.
