Our Silkie chickens in the garden. The whole family loves them, especially for the two eggs we get each day.

I got excited about automating the coop the moment we got them. Started in summer, upgraded for winter.

The base is a Run Chicken Villa Coop with an automatic door. I built the winter setup around it: two [Hama Matter smart plugs](LINK_HAMA) in HomeKit, a knockoff Pelican case for weatherproofing, a small heater inside, an [Onvis sensor](LINK_ONVIS) for temperature, a EufyCam C210, and a heated water bowl.

The automation keeps the inside above 2°C and warms up the water bowl in the morning so it's ice-free when they wake up. All controlled through HomeKit.
