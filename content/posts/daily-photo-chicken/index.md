When I went out with Aika, I caught two of our four chickens in the garden. We have two Silkie chickens and two feather-footed dwarf chickens. The whole family loves them, and two eggs a day is a nice bonus.

They've been with us since summer, and of course I had to automate their experience of staying with us.

The coop is a Run Chicken Villa with an automatic door. I added two [Hama Matter smart plugs](https://www.amazon.de/Hama-gesteuerte-Sprachsteuerung-Zeitschaltuhr-Funksteckdose/dp/B0CCSCH57P), a knockoff Pelican case to keep electronics dry, a small heater, an [Onvis temperature sensor](https://www.amazon.de/Onvis-Bewegungsmelder-Bewegungssensor-Temperatur-Feuchtigkeitsmesser-Automatische/dp/B0CNVTTS6X), a [eufyCam 2C](https://www.amazon.de/eufy-kabelloses-Überwachungskamera-zusätzliche-Akkulaufzeit/dp/B07XCC3GDX), and a heated water bowl.

When the temperature drops below 2°C, the heater kicks on for 30 minutes. The outdoor water bowl warms up before they wake up in the morning. Ice-free mornings, though whether they appreciate it, I have no idea. They better do!
