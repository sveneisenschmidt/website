My wife started baking bread. Here's her spelt (Deutsch: Dinkel) sourdough recipe. It took quite a few iterations to get it right.

We go through at least one loaf a week. The ratio between preparation time and how long the bread lasts is roughly 100 to 1. 

## Ingredients

- 600g spelt flour
- 350ml water
- 75g active whole grain rye starter
- 15g salt
- Ice cubes for steam

## Instructions

1. Mix flour and water, knead well, let it rest for 30 minutes. Nadine says this is called "autolyse" - sounds important.
2. Add starter and salt. Knead well and long.
3. Cover and let it rise for 2-3 hours. Knead and fold every 30 minutes - twice regular, twice coil folds.
4. Shape into a tight ball on the work surface, place in a proofing basket, cover and put in the fridge for 7-8 hours.
5. Preheat the oven to 240°C (top/bottom heat) with the pot inside.
6. Drop the dough in, score the top, add ice cubes for steam. Bake 20 minutes with the lid on, then 20 minutes at 210°C without.

The starter is off-limits. For everyone except Nadine.

*PS: Pizza works great with sourdough too, but that requires a completely different recipe.*
