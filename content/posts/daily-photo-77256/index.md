Got two Speed Champion BTTF sets ([#77256](https://www.lego.com/en-de/product/time-machine-from-back-to-the-future-77256)) for the boys. We watched the first two movies over the holidays for the first time with them and they loved it. Coincidentally Lego released this set January 1st.

I also ordered a Sony RX100 IV for myself. A reward for surviving the first day back at work. (Thanks to [Jasper](https://jasper.tandy.is/) for the orientation.)
