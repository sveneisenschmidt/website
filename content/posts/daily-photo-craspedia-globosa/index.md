Taken in our garden. [...]*Craspedia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae commonly known as billy buttons, billy balls, and woollyheads. They are native to Australia and New Zealand where they grow in a variety of habitats from sea level to the Southern Alps.*[...] ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craspedia)) - I'd would have called them **yellow balls**.
