Love this kid. Kellin can take a half-broken toy, a pile of week-old snow and immerse himself in a new adventure so easily.

We scavenged an old Canon EOS 1000D from Nadine's parents and combined it with an even older 80-200mm lens of my dad's from mid 90s. It's only 10MP but very accessible in playing around with settings, I was surprised how much Nadine went into it today and learned all about aperture, shutter speed and ISO settings. Probably more than I did with the Sony RX100 VII so far!
