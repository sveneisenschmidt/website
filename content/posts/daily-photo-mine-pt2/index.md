I went back to the open-cast mining ground and found a great spot to photograph these massive steel giants that have scarred the landscape.

The pictures were taken with a tripod and semi-manual mode of the Sony RX100 VII. Coincidentally, I complained this morning to [Jasper](https://jasper.tandy.is/) how I hate most of the pictures I took in the last days. Which is not true for these. That brings me joy.
