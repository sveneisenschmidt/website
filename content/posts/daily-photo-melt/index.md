Nadine went to Czechia to learn about tracking of wolves and other animals. She took the Sony RX100 VII and I got to use her new Canon EOS 2000D. The kids kept me busy inside and outside, the only shot that I eventually kept was the one of snow slowly melting down our greenhouse.

I'm planning to publish a guest post with photos from her trip here soon.
