Completed my trip back home today. Did twice 450km within 24 hours. The VW California is such a comfortable car for long trips.

I was close to home when I finished 2 1/2 hours of the 3 1/2 hours of the [Anthem documentary](https://youtu.be/CxwrCRdqZb8) Jasper shared with me. So many things went wrong with that game from such a previously respected studio like BioWare. I hope there will make a comeback one day. KotoR Remake, I’m counting on you.

I made a new friend this morning at a friend’s place in Munich. His name is Lucky. The photo reminds me of that offended cat meme at the dinner table.
