My year 2025 in numbers and highlights, wrapped-style. First attempt at summarizing an eventful year. More platforms offering wrapped/replay summaries obviously helped.

## Countries visited

This year I visited three countries beyond Germany: **France**, **Switzerland**, and **Austria**.

The highlight was attending the **Tour de France** in person. We watched the stage start in Montpellier. Too hot, too crowded. The merch caravan was a nice experience though. The second time we stood further down the road, which was more relaxing and yielded more merch for the kids. The freebies helped with their mood after waiting for hours at the side of the road just to see people on road bikes rush by in a matter of seconds. 

For the second stage we parked our camper van right at the roadside and had front row seats.

August was my month: 13 active days, 30 hours of riding. I was pushing for 100km+ each weekend and got into some kind of runner's high on the bike. Eventually I succumbed to being busy with other things. It's difficult to justify 4+ hours being away each weekend with everyone being busy at home. Still wondering how others manage to find the time for long rides.

I invested in a new bike computer, a Wahoo Ace. It first felt like a brick strapped to my handlebar. It's heavy, but after a few days of use I did not notice anymore. I like how much more information it provides compared to my old Wahoo Bolt v1. It also has a built-in headwind sensor, which helps me mentally deal with headwinds. Fun fact, I bought it at the same time as Wahoo soft-bricked a lot of their devices due to a time-based GPS bug that took them weeks to patch out.

## PlayStation

https://wrapup.playstation.com/

- **273** hours played
- **442** sessions
- **36** games played (31 PS5, 5 PS4)
- **11** hours on PlayStation Portal
- **195** trophies (5 Gold, 36 Silver, 154 Bronze)

### Top Games

1. **Assassin's Creed Shadows** *Action RPG* - 67 hours, 8/10. (Nice evolution of the formula. No mandatory side quests and you could easily follow the main story without missing out. Did not like that you played with two characters.)
2. **Astro Bot** *Platformer* - 53 hours. (Played by Tilian, 8.)
3. **LEGO Marvel's Avengers** *Action Adventure* - 29 hours. (Also Tilian.)
4. **Death Stranding 2: On The Beach** *Action Adventure* - 28 hours, 9/10. ([Wrote about it here](/posts/death-stranding-2/).)
5. **ARC Raiders** *Extraction Shooter* - 24 hours, 8/10. (Learned that extraction shooters are not for me. The unpredictable PvP and recurring wipes don't work with my need for permanent progression. Only played in duo with Jan.)

My two favorites this year: **Death Stranding 2** and **Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater**.

## Steam

https://store.steampowered.com/replay/

- **23** games played (-20 vs 2024)
- **198** sessions
- **99%** on Steam Deck
- **161** achievements (-78 vs 2024)
- **9** days longest streak (Feb 1-10)

### Top Games

1. **Hades II** *Action Roguelike* - 18% playtime, 31 sessions, 9/10. (A better version of Hades I, not more and not less. The end game was long though. Repetitively fighting bosses without any progression, just to increase the internal counter of x times defeated to progress to the end.)
2. **Deadzone: Rogue** *Roguelike Shooter* - 17% playtime, 23 sessions, 8/10. (No idea why I played this so much. Very straightforward, ran well on the Deck and was a low effort shooter. I guess I used this to compensate for a missing Call of Duty experience this year.)
3. **Bladechimera** *Metroidvania* - 13% playtime, 20 sessions, 9/10. (Played this with Jasper when he was over, I had so much fun with it. Can't speak for him though.)
4. **Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound** *Metroidvania* - 7% playtime, 7/10. (From [The Game Kitchen](https://thegamekitchen.com/) who made Blasphemous I + II. Fantastic game, similar to Bladechimera. Fun to play but very difficult.)
5. **Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance** *Hack and Slash* - 7% playtime, 8/10. (A core memory of mine. Streamed it years ago so Jasper could watch from the UK and we basically finished it over stream together. What a nuts game, easy to beat sub eight hours. Always great to come back to and I hope they one day make a second one.)

I mostly played Roguelikes this year. Two peak months, February and August, made up 60% of my gaming time.

## Nintendo Switch

I got the **Switch 2** this year. The biggest USP is that it runs Switch 1 games better. There is not a single platform seller game for me to justify the purchase really.

**Minecraft Dungeons** *Action RPG* (9/10) was a great surprise. A Diablo killer, better than Diablo IV. The local co-op is fun to play with my 8-year-old son Tilian. **Mario Kart World** *Racing* (6/10) was a disappointment, more of the same and actually felt like a step back from the previous installment.

## Biggest gaming disappointments this year

There are games I could not get into, as much as I wanted:
- **Metroid Prime 4** *FPS Adventure* (Nintendo Switch) - 6/10
- **Mario Kart World** *Racing* (Nintendo Switch) - 6/10
- **Ghost of Yōtei** *Action Adventure* (PlayStation) - 7/10
- **Borderlands 4** *Looter Shooter* (PlayStation) - 6/10

It was also the first year I did not play the most recent Call of Duty game. The reviews were disheartening and the campaign was supposed to be a mess. 


## Movies and TV Shows

1. [**Pluribus**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22202452/) *Sci-Fi Drama* (TV Show) - 9.5/10. (Nice cinematography, focus on single persons over multiple parallel story arcs, solid foreshadowing, nothing over the top and 4-D chess. Very approachable and digestible. Excited for the new season in 2-3 years!)
2. [**One Battle After Another**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30144839/) *Action Drama* (Movie) - 9/10. (Appreciated the overall length, felt nicely timed. Sean Penn's acting was great. It felt like a whole and well rounded movie.)
3. [**The Day of the Jackal**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt24053860/) *Thriller* (TV Show) - 9/10. (Not finished yet, halfway through. Too much emphasis on the family back in Spain/Portugal and them eventually foiling his plans. Eddie Redmayne's acting is awesome to watch.)
4. [**Midsommar**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8772262/) *Horror* (Movie) - 8/10. (Just shocking.)
5. [**Foundation**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804484/) *Sci-Fi Drama* (TV Show) - 9/10. (The slow decline of the Empire, the hedonist Cleon and less focus on Hari Seldon and the Foundation. The twist at the end about the Mule was exciting but then felt rushed, as if scenes were missing.)
6. [**Sinners**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31193180/) *Horror* (Movie) - 8/10. (Feels like a modern From Dusk Till Dawn.)
7. [**The Long Walk**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10374610/) *Horror Thriller* (Movie) - 8/10. (Finally a solid, not over the top, straightforward Stephen King adaptation.)
8. [**28 Years Later**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10548174/) *Horror* (Movie) - 8/10. (Felt like coming back to an old friend. Also crazy how jacked Aaron Taylor-Johnson is now.)
9. [**Warfare**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31434639/) *War Drama* (Movie) - 8/10. (Gritty, simple, no sugar coating.)

I wanted to use Letterboxd but logging and rating feels like work. JustWatch was my go-to for watchlists but everything is behind a subscription now. Maybe a self-hosted alternative using IMDB/TMDB data. Next open source project?

This year I started using [Infuse](https://firecore.com/infuse) for digitized media from Blu-rays and DVDs. Infuse is a serverless media player. No transcoding server needed. I pay for the yearly subscription, my media library lives on a NAS, and the library syncs via iCloud. Previously I used Plex but their pricing and freemium policies became unbearable. Infuse plays everything: 4K HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos pass-through.

## Apple Music Replay

### Top Albums

1. [**BODIES**](https://www.last.fm/music/Thornhill/BODIES) *Progressive Metalcore* - Thornhill (Like they made a soundtrack for a DOOM game. They should team up with Mick Gordon.)
2. [**Tsunami Sea**](https://www.last.fm/music/Spiritbox/Tsunami+Sea) *Progressive Metalcore* - Spiritbox
3. [**Eternal Blue**](https://www.last.fm/music/Spiritbox/Eternal+Blue) *Progressive Metalcore* - Spiritbox

[**Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair**](https://www.last.fm/music/La+Dispute/Somewhere+at+the+Bottom+of+the+River+Between+Vega+and+Altair) *Post-Hardcore* - La Dispute (This record was released in 2008, I discovered it mid 2010s based on a recommendation from Jasper. Since then I listen to it multiple times a year. La Dispute lost me on their newer releases, they are not bad but just not my taste anymore.)
5. [**Lo-Files**](https://www.last.fm/music/Bring+Me+the+Horizon/Lo-Files) *Pop Rock* - Bring Me the Horizon (In my defence, this is often played in our kitchen during dinner.)
