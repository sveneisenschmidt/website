Over the Xmas period I managed to finish Death Stranding 2. I like it more than the Metal Gear Solid games.

I played it on a Steam Deck OLED via PS Remote Play connected to a PS5 Pro. The experience was flawless. I used [chiaki-ng](https://flathub.org/en/apps/io.github.streetpea.Chiaki4deck) and have a WiFi 6 capable network at home.

The game is a perfect mix between logistics, base building and shooter action for me. The story was emotionally draining. Typical for Kojima, he takes the liberty to add things for the sake of coolness, not because they make sense. "Sense" in the context of an already nuts story and universe. [This Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/1m7oqbq/death_stranding_2_a_beautiful_ending_wrapped_in/) tied up the loose ends for me and explained things that are never explicitly resolved in the game, at least to my understanding.

Favorite performances: Lea Seydoux as Fragile and Troy Baker as Higgs. Baker's performance is nuts. Tommie Earl Jenkins deserves a mention too. Spoiler: his return at the end of the game and his unusual performance were a nice balance to the overall sad story.

Also surprised by Kojima's thing for German actors and directors. Alissa Jung and Fatih Akin both have roles. I wonder what made him choose them.

Final rating: 9/10.
