Neither Aika nor I woke up this morning and thought "Hey let's rip out a toe nail, that sounds like fun!". Yet here we are and we spent this afternoon at the vet.

I am surprised how "cheap" it was to get today's daily photo, just 59€. I did not expect it to be so affordable. 

On a side note, I did not expect that taking a photo every day would occupy so much of my thoughts. It would be too easy to just skip.
