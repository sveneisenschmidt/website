Tilian and me went to take pictures of the 'open-cast mining ground' close to our village.

We tried to take good pictures, unfortunately the only accessible viewpoint had the sun directly facing towards us and there was quite the haze. I needed to use the full zoom to at least capture some details of the mine. Not happy with the result but at least we got some pictures and left the house.
