Week started well at work and I can use the morning hours again for a longer walk with Aika before hitting the desk. Winter mornings don't offer great light, yet it's the only time I have to take pictures during week days.

The Sony RX100 VII has been fun to use. The grain it produces in low light is great. I like the depth it captured here. The sky above the roof is overexposed where the rising sun came through, but given that no light was hitting the wall itself, it's an OK compromise.

I took a few more pictures but decided to only have one daily photo moving forward to make me choose the one I like best.
