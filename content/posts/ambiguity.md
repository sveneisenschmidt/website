Ambiguity gets a bad reputation at work, and people treat it like a warning sign. "There's no clear direction." "Leadership doesn't have a plan." I've sat in meetings where someone said exactly that, and everyone nodded along.

Ten years ago I would have agreed because back then I wanted clarity, defined requirements, a plan I could follow. I thought that's what good leadership looked like: removing uncertainty so people can execute. I expected my manager to do that for me. He didn't, and I'm grateful for it. Thanks [Daniel](https://www.flowplace.com/daniel-troeger).

Then I got my first management role and suddenly complaining about unclear requirements wasn't useful anymore. As a developer I could point at the mess and say "this isn't defined well enough," but as a manager nobody cared. If I had kept saying "this isn't defined well enough" in that role, what would have happened in my next performance review? I probably wouldn't be where I am today. I wasn't measured by the code I wrote, I was measured by whether my team hit its goals, and hitting those goals isn't just some corporate phrase. It's often about whether a product survives or gets killed, whether a vision lives on or gets abandoned, whether the company makes it or doesn't. There was no option to not deliver.

The projects where I had the most impact weren't the ones with perfect specs and detailed plans, they were the messy ones. The ones where someone said "figure it out" and meant it, not because anyone trusted me specifically, but because there was a goal and someone had to make it happen.

People confuse ambiguity with the absence of strategy but that's not how it works. Strategy tells you what you're not going to do. It sets boundaries. Principles tell you who you are. But neither hands you a playbook for Tuesday morning. The space in between is yours to fill. I don't know why people expect a detailed plan from the top, maybe it feels safer, but that's not how any of this works in practice. The higher up you go, the less detailed the guidance becomes, and that's by design.

Over the years I've seen people respond to ambiguity in different ways. Some hold on to old plans because the plan said X, so we're doing X. But if the business reality changed in the last four weeks, how can you not react to that? Seriously? The plan was based on assumptions, the assumptions changed, and the plan is now fiction.

Others just figure it out. They make calls, they try things, they're wrong sometimes and adjust. Those are the people who ship things that weren't planned but solved real problems.

There is no certainty in product development and I think a lot of people struggle with accepting that. We're building things for eight billion people, markets shift weekly, competitors do things you didn't anticipate, and users behave in ways that make no sense until suddenly they do. If you need everything nailed down before you start, you're too slow.

We're not surgeons, pilots, or paramedics. Those jobs need fixed routines because mistakes kill people, but software development isn't like that. If we ship something wrong we can fix it, and if we make a bad call we learn and adjust. The cost of being wrong is low. The cost of being slow is high.

Two things help: looking at data and being fast. Looking at data doesn't mean having all the answers upfront, it means moving, measuring, and correcting course. You ship something small, you look at the numbers, you adjust. That's it. And speed matters more than people admit because the problem with software development is that it often takes forever. Weeks turn into months, months turn into quarters, and by the time you ship, the world moved on. Ambiguity rewards people who can make decisions quickly and live with being wrong sometimes.

Moving first sounds obvious until you've spent three weeks in a planning loop that produced nothing but slides. I've been there, it's exhausting, and at the end you still have to build the thing anyway.

I've seen growing companies try to establish behaviors, processes, and rules that would kill any startup within weeks. More approvals, more sign-offs, more alignment meetings. The desire to play it safe, to wait for clarity, to not move until everything is defined. That's a slow death. If you don't move first, you're just waiting for someone else to outrun you.

What helps is having a strong opinion on how things should be done. That opinion can come from experience, from data, or from both, but you need one. People with opinions propose things, and people who propose things lead. People who don't propose get led, by their manager, by stakeholders, or by the absence of company success. Choose an approach and ask yourself what makes you happier at work.

Ambiguity is not something to manage or to complain about. It's the space where you actually get to decide things, and that's the whole point of the job. Isn't that what people want, to actually decide?
