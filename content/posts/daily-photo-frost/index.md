Last night's frost laid a soft film over all surfaces.

I've been testing photo import and touch-up workflows. Pretty happy with [Photomator](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/photomator/id1444636541) and a dedicated folder in iCloud Photos. As I write this, I have 22,972 photos in my library going back to 2010.

I was afraid of losing access to iCloud and my photo library. I used an abandoned [Python script](https://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader) to sync everything to my NAS a few times a year. This morning I discovered [Parachute Backup](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/parachute-backup/id6748614170) and it does the job of exporting media from my library into a dedicated folder. It only requires access to my local iCloud Photo library on my Mac, not the iCloud account itself, that's already an advantage over the Python script I used previously.
